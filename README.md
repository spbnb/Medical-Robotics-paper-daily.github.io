# FBG Surgical Robotics Arxiv Daily

This is an automated project designed to fetch the latest papers from arXiv daily, use AI (currently via OpenRouter API) to filter papers related to FBG sensing, FBG force/shape sensing algorithms, surgical robotics, surgical robot navigation, bronchoscopy navigation algorithms, soft robotics, and VLA methods for these domains, generate structured JSON data and aesthetically pleasing HTML pages, and finally automatically deploy the results to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions.

## Features

1.  **Data Fetching**: Automatically fetches candidate papers from configured arXiv categories daily (default currently: cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.CV, cs.LG), with built-in retry logic and exponential backoff to handle arXiv API rate limiting (HTTP 429).
2.  **AI Filtering**: Uses LLM to intelligently filter papers related to FBG sensing, FBG force/shape sensing algorithms, surgical robotics/navigation, bronchoscopy navigation, soft robotics, and VLA-based algorithmic methods, then scores paper value across different dimensions.
3.  **Data Storage**: Saves the filtered paper information (title, abstract, link, etc.) as date-named JSON files (stored in the `daily_json/` directory).
4.  **Web Page Generation**: Generates daily HTML reports based on the JSON data using a preset template (stored in the `daily_html/` directory) and updates the main entry page `index.html`.
5.  **Automated Deployment**: Implements the complete process of daily scheduled fetching, filtering, generation, and deployment to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions.
6.  **Automatic Backfill**: Detects missing dates in the `daily_json/` directory and automatically backfills them, ensuring no gaps in the paper archive even if previous workflow runs failed.
7.  **Full-Text Paper Search**: Provides a client-side search page (`search.html`) powered by [MiniSearch](https://lucaong.github.io/minisearch/), allowing users to search across all papers by title, abstract, or author name with AND-matching for precise results.

## Tech Stack

*   **Backend/Script**: Python 3.x (`arxiv`, `requests`, `jinja2`)
*   **Frontend**: HTML5, TailwindCSS (CDN), JavaScript, Framer Motion (CDN)
*   **Automation**: GitHub Actions
*   **Deployment**: GitHub Pages

## Installation

1.  **Clone Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd Robotics_paper_daily
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate Virtual Environment** (Recommended):
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
    # Or .\\.venv\\Scripts\\activate # Windows
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**: All required Python libraries are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Configure API Key**: This project requires an OpenRouter API Key for AI filtering. Of course, you can also modify `src/filter.py` to call other LLM APIs. For security, do not hardcode the key in the code. Set it as an environment variable when running locally. In GitHub Actions, set it as a Secret named `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`.

## Usage

### Local Run

You can directly run the main script `main.py` to manually trigger a complete process (fetch, filter, generate).

```bash
# Ensure the OPENROUTER_API_KEY environment variable is set
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY='your_openrouter_api_key'

# Run the main script (processes today's papers by default)
python src/main.py

# (Optional) Run for a specific date
# python src/main.py --date YYYY-MM-DD

# (Optional) Enable automatic backfill of missing dates
python src/main.py --backfill

# (Optional) Limit the number of dates to backfill per run (default: 5)
python src/main.py --backfill --backfill-limit 3
```

After successful execution:
*   The JSON data for the day will be saved in `daily_json/YYYY-MM-DD.json`.
*   The HTML report for the day will be saved in `daily_html/YYYY_MM_DD.html`.
*   The main entry page `index.html` will be updated to include the link to the latest report.
*   A search index `search_index.json` will be generated covering all papers across all dates.

You can open `index.html` directly in your browser to view the results.

### GitHub Actions Automation

The repository is configured with a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/daily_arxiv.yml`).

*   **Scheduled Trigger**: The workflow is set to run automatically at a scheduled time daily by default.
*   **Manual Trigger**: You can also manually trigger this workflow from the Actions page of your GitHub repository.

The workflow automatically completes all steps and deploys the generated `index.html`, `daily_json/`, and `daily_html/` directory files to GitHub Pages.

## Viewing Deployment Results

The project is configured to display results via GitHub Pages. Please visit your GitHub Pages URL (usually `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repository-name>/`) to view the daily updated paper reports.
